## Problem Statement
The slow adoption of electric vehicles is hindered by challenges in charging infrastructure and energy inefficiency. Surplus energy goes to waste due to lack of storage and convenient urban charging options. This delay in progress towards climate goals intensifies pollution and worsens climate change. Efficient energy use and accessible electric vehicle charging infrastructure are crucial for a sustainable future mobility system, necessitating urgent solutions.


## What Green Charge do?
- To make everything secure and fair,we implemented a  blockchain framework to integrate the energy provider to the electric vehicle owner.
- When you charge your EV, you pay for the electricity you use, and we make sure everything is transparent and trustworthy. That way, you know you're getting the energy you paid for.
- With Green Charge,we help electric vehicle (EV) owners to find out where they are and tell them the closest place to charge their EVs.
- Using Machine Learning algorithms, Green Charge will forecast surplus energy production in order to provide the best possible service to electric vehicle owners.
- With GreenCharge, we ensure that extra electricity is not wasted. It helps EV owners find charging spots easily, and it makes sure everything is fair and secure using blockchain.
