    <p class="about_text">
      Our solution, known as "GreenCharge," is all about making the most of the energy we generate,
      especially during times when it's not used much, like at night or when the sun is shining brightly.
      You see, sometimes we produce more electricity than we can use, and the extra power just goes
      to waste because storing it for a long time is really hard and costly. So, GreenCharge steps in to
      fix this.
    </p>
    <p class="about_text">
      We use AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms to predict when we're going to have extra
      electricity. It's like having a crystal ball that tells us when we'll have more power than we need.
      When we know that, we can be smart about using it. One of the great things we do is help
      electric vehicle (EV) owners. We find out where they are and tell them the closest place to
      charge their EVs. That's really handy, right?
    </p>
    <p class="about_text">
      But that's not all! Tomake everything secure and fair, we also use blockchain. It's like a supersecure
      digital ledger that keeps track of all the transactions. When you charge your EV, you pay
      for the electricity you use, and we make sure everything is transparent and trustworthy. That
      way, you know you're getting the energy you paid for.
    </p>
    <p class="about_text">
      So, GreenCharge helps the planet by making sure we don't waste extra electricity. It helps EV
      owners find charging spots easily, and itmakes sure everything is fair and secure using
      blockchain. It's like having a smart friend that looks out for our energy and environment while
      making our lives more convenient.
